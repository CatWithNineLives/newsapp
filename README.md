# newsapp
A react native app that fetches news from the smallcase api (https://developers.gateway.smallcase.com/reference/fetch-news) 
and displays the information in two views, 
Comfortable and Compact. The Comfortable view displays the truncated headline and summary - it can be expanded to view the full headline, summary and createdAt date
for the news article.
The app implements infinite scrolling using FlatList.
